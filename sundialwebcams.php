We are not the first to have the craziness to watch the shadow on a sundial move and then broadcast it to the rest of the world...

<h3>New College, Oxford University, UK (active)</h3>

Live video of the <a href="http://www.new.ox.ac.uk/sundial-camera">New College Sundial</a>, 1&deg; West of the Greenwich Meridian.

<h3>University of Calgary, Canada  (sometimes active)</h3>

A small, precise <a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/rao/gnomon">horizontal sundial</a> is under a webcam at the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory, Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, University of Calgary. Live images are available <a href="http://136.159.57.151/netcam.jpg">here</a>. This is not a sundial in the usual sense since the horizontal surface is marked only with a 2-cm Cartesian grid, designed for students to measure (x, y)'s and do some calculations!

<h3>Pembroke College, Cambridge University, UK (inactive)</h3>

Designed by Frank King in 1997, the Pembroke College wall dial (in the Foundress Court) soon came under the watchful eye of an <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/sundial">unrelated webcam</a> that was based in a nearby computer science research lab. There were no animations produced, but the setup had the unique feature of employing image-processing software that actually read the dial shadow and then displayed the measured (solar) time! The webcam operated from 1998 to ~2003. The image below is an example.

<h3>University of Wisconsin-River Falls, Wisconsin, USA (inactive)</h3>

Designed by John Shepherd in 1994, the Richard D. Swenson dial (on the Kleinpell Fine Arts Building) is a very large dial on a due-south wall; a full description can be found <a href="http://www.uwrf.edu/AboutUs/RichardSwensenSundial.cfm">here</a>. The webcam operated over 1998-2004, but no time-lapses are extant.


<h3>EarthDial Project (inactive, but animations available)</h3>

A flurry of sundial webcams existed in 2004-05 when the <a href="http://planetary.org/programs/projects/earthdial/">EarthDial Project</a>, the <a href="http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/earthdial/history.html">invention of Bill Nye and Woody Sullivan</a>, was run under the auspices of The Planetary Society. The Project was run in conjunction with the <a href="http://planetary.org/programs/projects/marsdial/">MarsDial Project</a>, which involved the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity, each of which landed on Mars in 2004 with a small MarsDial on its deck. For the EarthDial Project persons around the world were urged to build sundials of a standard design under a webcam. These images were then made available on a single website (the user clicked on a map to see the individual real-time images). At its peak in late 2004, about 20 EarthDials were operating well in countries not only in Europe and North America, but also in Brazil, Honduras, Malaysia, Israel, and Australia -- for a short time one even existed at the South Pole Research Station! Altogether about <a href="http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/earthdial/network.html">40 EarthDials</a> participated in the Project. Several sites made animations of the shadows cast by their EarthDial gnomons at different seasons, etc. Here are some examples:

<h3>Skyscraper as gnomon in Queens, New York City, USA </h3>

This animation is more an <a href="http://licsundial.net/?page_id=2">art project</a> than a sundial, but is worth listing here. Over 9 hours on 13 May 2007  artist Heidi Neilson followed, as well as she could in an urban environment, the tip of the shadow of a 200-meter (660-ft)-tall skyscraper, taking a photo about every two minutes, looking back up at the building's top.
